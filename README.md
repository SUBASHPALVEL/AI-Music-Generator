Building music systems can be done in a variety of ways, such as using computer-generated scenery, performing musical instruments, considering the craft of sound recording, and more. The student's time is the biggest obstacle in music creation, and they could express frustration with their lack of musical ability. The music compositions help increase a student's greater vocabulary to make them more confident. This time, the system is designed to produce musical compositions automatically using the dataset we used to train the model.The dataset we used consists of 330 recordings of classical music that are available for free, together with over 1 million annotated labels that list the exact timing of each note in each recording, the instrument that plays it, and where the note falls in the composition's metrical structure. In order to acquire the best results from the data we gathered, the model is trained with 250 epoches. These are the outcomes of our model's training using various compilers. The local machine we utilised for training has an 8GB RAM and a Ryzen 550U processor.

  As can be seen from the comparison above, training a model on a local machine requires a lot of time, making it impossible for a student to complete. Nevertheless, by using cloud compilers like Google Colab and Intel OneApi, we substantially cut the time, making it easier and more accessible for students to learn AI and ML.
